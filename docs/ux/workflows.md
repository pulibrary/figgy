## Ephemera
### Latin American Ephemera
1. Each item is placed in a folder, and a set of approximately 300 items are placed in a box.
2. The folders and boxes are numbered and barcoded.
3. Metadata is created for boxes and folders as they are created.
4. When a box is full, it's shipped to a digitization vendor.
5. A hard drive is received from the vendor, and files are attached to the metadata records created above.
6. The box of ephemera is transferred to ReCAP for storage.

### Other ephemera projects
Some projects collect both physical and digital ephemera, and do not use the same box/folder/barcode system as LAE.  Some items (such as posters) are not stored in boxes because of their size.  Digital items may be linked to and stored in DSpace, and are obviously not stored in boxes.

## Books and Manuscripts
1. Books and manuscripts are photographed by the digitization studio, with TIFF page images stored on a local staging server.
2. ScannedResources are created when photography is complete, using a BibID or PULFA component ID to retrieve remote metadata.
3. Files are uploaded using a file browser, which accesses the TIFFs on a network-mounted share.
4. When the files have been loaded, the object is reviewed by Cataloging & Metadata Services, including adding structural metadata.
5. After metadata review, the item is reviewed by the appropriate curator.
6. After curatorial review, the item is published.
