# Figgy Use Cases

## Multiple representations of the same resource
A resource may have more than one digitized representation. One known use case is where we have digitized and made publicly available the table of contents for an item, and added that to the catalog record as a link to the PDF. Then later a patron requests the item and we digitize it in full to make it available via the Virtual Reading Room / OARSC. The fully-digitized resource needs to be linked to the same catalog record as the excerpt, but needs its own ARK identifier
