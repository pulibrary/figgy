### Requested lead time
One Week

One week allows folks the time to reschedule students who may be normally working in figgy in that three hour window.  It also allows folks time to know when not to kick off large ingests. For SC and Mudd Colleagues, it allows them to plan for no PDF downloads during that time, until ticket #2866 is closed.

Fridays are scheduled ingest times for Branch libraries dependent on structured workflows to get the jobs done like Lewis and larger scanning operations, Like Microforms.
