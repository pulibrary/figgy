### Requested lead time
One Week

One week allows folks the time to reschedule students who may be normally working in figgy in that three hour window.  It also allows folks time to know when not to kick off large ingests. For SC and Mudd Colleagues, it allows them to plan for no PDF downloads during that time, until ticket #2866 is closed.

### Bad day(s) for Read Only Figgy mode
Fridays

Fridays are scheduled ingest times for Branch libraries dependent on structured workflows to get the jobs done like Lewis and larger scanning operations, Like Microforms. 

### Where to distribute information for Read Only?
- Email affected stakeholders (anyone named in the list above)
- Message the following slack channels:
  - #digital_library (mention @photographers)
  - #ephemera_projects

### What to include in message
- Date / time/ expectation
- What does Read Only Mean? What can/can't you do in Figgy?
  - In read only mode, search and view of resources continue to function. Ingest and metadata updates will not work. PDFs cannot be generated, so only PDFs that have previously been generated are downloadable.
- Post questions/comments/concerns in the #digital_library Slack channel.
- Please tell your friends and colleagues who may want to know! Sharing is caring.
