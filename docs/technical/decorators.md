Decorators are used to add presentation logic to models, and implemented via the [Draper library](https://github.com/drapergem/draper).

They can be used in places other than just views, though. In particular you will see them [used in indexers](https://github.com/pulibrary/figgy/blob/fc3ddbddea3717db1b6e9f53eb79f34e4f9e0e99/app/indexers/human_readable_type_indexer.rb#L11).
