# State-based workflow for books: The primary workflow is to start at pending, and progress through
# metadata_review and final_review to complete.  There are two exceptional workflows: between
# complete/takedown (for issues requiring an item be suppressed), and between complete/flagged (for issues
# where an item can remain accessible).
