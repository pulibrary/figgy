# This is a custom query which finds all members of an object as well as
# populates `loaded` with a hash of objects eager loaded from a relationship.
# For instance, if a member has `genres` with a value of
# [Valkyrie::ID.new("bla")], and it's loaded by this query, it will have a
# loaded value of
#
# ```ruby
# {
#   genre: { genre_id => genre_object }
# }
# ```
#
# This can help in reducing N+1 queries.
