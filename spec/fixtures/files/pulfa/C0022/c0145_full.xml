Also "Camp à Waterman's Tavern, le 9 Novembre, 10 miles de Walen-Town. Voyés Campagne 1781, 2e Camp" [no map], "Camp à Providence, le 10 Novembre, 15 miles de Waterman's Tavern, l'armée sur
                        deux Lignes dans l'ancien Camp de la Brigade de Soissonnois. Voyés la Campagne 1781, 1er Camp" [no map]. 13 November - 4 December 1782. Proceeding from Voluntown (Sterling Hill) the army made its next (50th) camp at Waterman's
                        Tavern on the site occupied the previous year (cf. Nos. 14 and 28) and then, upon reaching Providence, camped again (51st camp) on the western outskirts of the town, as it had done in June 1781 when beginning the march to the
                        Hudson (cf. Nos. 14 and 27).</p><p>After pausing for three days on the former camp ground the two brigades marched through Providence to another site north of town, as shown on the present map. According to Von Closen (p. 267), the move was determined by the
                        landowner's refusal to agree to the cutting of wood on his property. The new camp, described my Verger as "barracks in a wood" (p. 169), was on the farm of Jeremiah Dexter, overlooking the Boston road, in what was then North
                        Providence. Present Camp Street and Rochambeau Avenue are in the vicinity.</p><p>The troops remained here in North Providence until Vaudreuil's ships at Boston were ready to receive them. They left successively in four divisions: Bourbonnais on I December, Soissonnais on the 2nd, Saintonge of the 3rd, and
                        Royal Deux-Ponts on the 4th. The artillery, however, had left Providence for Boston a fortnight earlier (16-17 November), "because of the large amount of materiel to be embarked" (cf. Clermont-Crèvecœur's journal, p. 81).</p><p>The inclusion of a stretch of the "Pattukey River" (i.e., the Pawtucket, now called the Seekonk), upper right of th map, is a reminder that a French vessel, the Fantasque, was anchored here. As noted by Verger (p. 169), a
                        detachment commanded by M. d'Espeyron, major of the Soissonnais Regiment, comprising one company from each of the four regiments, was embarked on the Fantasque, also used as a hospital ship. This vessel, which was in bad
                        repair, did not join Vaudreuil's fleet as planned and remained here until early February 1783. Thus French soldiers were to be seen in Providence for another two months after the departure of the main corps of the army.</p><p>It was at Providence that General Rochambeau took leave of his army and handed over the command to Baron de Vioménil.</p></scopecontent><bibliography><p>MS, No. 39-50/52.
